The amount of cash tied up in payments virtually <br>ensures that paying off the debt is next to impossible. The only way out appears to be a loan consolidation with a surefire end date which is why the 22.06% APR does not look bad to me at all. One of the reasons for the excessive debt is that I chose to pay for my Computer Science degree and computer certifications instead of taking out student loans which would have amounted to a lot more than $30,000. I have over 15 years of excellent payment history on all my debts and two small loans on Lending club one of which is paid of and the other one 3/4 paid off as well.

I strongly prefer not to negotiate with my lenders / banks to bring my debt load down because A, I can afford to pay it off in full and honor my commitments. And B, I've never made a late payment. As far as my repayment record goes, I'm spotless.

The funds will be an extension to the bridge of capital on-hand to assist in expanding our business and making necessary purchases and upgrades that will not only improve the effectiveness and efficiency of our internal operations, but also greatly enhance the customers' overall shopping experience. We will use the funds for the following: A cash register with robust storage and automation capabilities; more shelving for the larger storage room; a larger company sign, advertisement in adjacent communities, small customer and employee incentives, inventory scanners, aesthetic details and upgrades that appeal to the senses of our customers, a larger retail space. What makes me a good borrower is my history with the Lending Club as well as my credit score. We obtained some funding when we opened the doors to our company last year. In just a short amount of time we were able to pay that loan off in full. I am in the U.S. Army so my income is more than stable. I earn a comfortable salary, and I have a little more than 10 years until I retire. My business partner and I are not fans of debt. We barely have any. I have a cell phone bill, and car insurance payments. I receive a housing stipend so my rent, food, and utilities are paid by the military. My best friend and business partner has a cell phone bill, drives a scooter (paid for with cash and has a $20 per month insurance bill), and is pursuing his MBA. He is totally immersed in the world of business and believes in providing for the business first. So other than books for school and maybe an occassional quick bite from a restaurant his debt is minimal as well. We whole-heartedly believe in living well below our means. Our life is our company, and we enjoy the sweat we put into it while watching it grow. We see no need in going through banks to apply for business loans with minimums of $50,000-$150,000. Those amounts do not match the steady and calculated pace of our business. After Lending Club was featured on CNBC earlier this year, my partner and I knew we were in the among great company, and chose to come back to where we started for capital supplementation.<br/>",small_business,Expansion,735xx,OK,0.0,0.0,Apr-2002,2.0,,,2.0,0.0,0,0.0,18.0,f,0.0,0.0,29617.8699192191,29547.44,21025.0,8592.87,0.0,0.0,0.0,May-2015,7033.62,,Jun-2015,0.0,,1,Individual,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cash,N,,,,,,

While I do have college savings and a home, I would rather not tap into those secure investments to pay off my credit cards.

The easy answer would be to go to a credit counseling company, but it is my obligation to pay off my debt, which is what I will do with this structured loan.

As a result, I have never been late in my five years of owning the home.  In addition, I proudly own a home in full.

Please see below notes for clarification on my loan proceeds.<br/>I currently hold three credit cards totaling $35,000.00.  The payments on all three cards total $1,100.00 at an average interest rate of about 23.50%.  This debt is not a cash flow problem as my monthly salary is $15,000.00 per month.<br/>I have no student loans and only one car loan at a great 3.50% rate.  <br/>I have three mortgages on rental properties totaling monthly PITI payments of about $8,000.00 per month.  My net rental income on these properties is $10,000 per month, giving me a solid cash flow.  <br/>The reason for my current balance on the cards was due to recent remodel of a rental property and paying some medical expenses.  Because of credit card indebtedness, my credit score dipped from 740 to 680.  With that said, the plan is to free up these cards to increase my credit score back over 700 and refinance my recently remodeled rental property at a better interest rate.  That refinance will include the payoff of this new loan request.  I hope this paints a better picture for you.

I only included the amounts above because I am still liable for them during this time, even though the Air Force is paying them as an Enlistment Bonus.

I am aware that it will damage my FICO score, but I don't want or need any of these accounts or the fees.<br><br>  I have been working for my employer for about 4 years now and it is a full time and very stable position, and I enjoy it very much. <br><br>  I have always made all my payments on time except one in 2006 which was accidentally not updated when I moved and did not give the bank the right address. I missed one payment but have always been on time since then.<br><br>  If you have any questions, please let me know. Borrower added on 06/21/11 > I would like to add that my FICO score is quite low, but only because I recently changed from a big bank to a small credit union.  I also refinanced my two cars through them, and I also looked into refinancing my house with them.  Finally, they extended a line of credit for what they call &quot;Instant deposit&quot; which allows me to mail checks to them but credit my account in the meanwhile.  <br/><br/>As a result, my credit report FICO score took a 40 point hit from around 700 to 660, resulting in my disappointing &quot;F1&quot; score here on LendingClub.  My other LendingClub account before this was rated MUCH more favorably (it was a B or C score I think?) and nothing has changed much in terms of my overall credit standing.<br/>",credit_card,Credit card consolidation loan,201xx,VA,17.78,0.0,Oct-1996,2.0,,99.0,15.0,1.0,17419,57.9,37.0,f,0.0,0.0,19892.0608456382,19863.81,17600.0,2292.06,0.0,0.0,0.0,Mar-2012,16619.03,,Sep-2015,0.0,,1,Individual,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cash,N,,,,,,

I have partnered with two individuals who bring the experience needed to make this business successful. One of the individual's has the direct experience needed to manage the daily operations and personnel of a confectionary kiosk and the other has the experience in managing the finances. Partnering with these individuals allows me to own the business but also keep my current employee status where I have been working for 22 years and would be easily able to pay the monthly payment if necessary. Throughout our business plan we have made very conservative estimates of our monthly cash workflow and I am very confident that the business will not only be able to pay all of its required expenses but within the first year finish with a positive profit margin.

This is for heating, electricity, plumbing, and the building of a bathroom, bedroom, and kitchenette - leaving a large open space as a living area.<br/>   This should probably be noted - when my wife and I got the house, we had the chance for the seller to finish the basement. However, they would only do it one way - not the way we would want (small rooms, small hallways, small bathroom). We were thinking no hallways - just the open space with rooms branching off.  Because they wouldn't do it our way, we chose not to have it done when it could have been wrapped into our mortgage. I have since received a raise and been put on a bonus program - giving us the income to be able to get a loan to get the basement done and done our way.  My wife is also newly pregnant, so we've gained some urgency (as the bedroom to be added will be used as an office, opening a bedroom upstairs for the nursery). Because of the urgency, we've made the decision to get a loan now over saving over the next 4 years to get it done later. It is, of course, too late to wrap it into a mortgage - and we don't have the equity built up enough to get a loan on the equity.

We have prepared for over 2 years for this event and are now less than 3 weeks from opening.   Our plan is simple: Become a customer friendly, phenomenal tasting, one-stop treat shop!   We will also carry one of the finest Italian Coffees, which is a highly anticipated drink for the 200+ employees in the Administration building in our same parking lot.  Our shop is in a tremendous location next to the corner of a heavily traveled intersection and less than 1 mile from 2 major highways intersecting.   Our Competition?  The usual grocery stores that use box-mix and not 'made from scratch' ingredients!  That have store-bought ice cream, which is not home-made.    Our success was never in doubt and our sales expectations exceed $300k annually.  We are need of a little more capital in order to purchase some new equipment, like a $15k walk-in cooler/freezer combo that will benefit us more in the long run over the standard 3 door freezer and 3 door fridge. It is 5 times their size and saves $150/month in electricity since the condensers are roof-mounted and will not heat the store up, which would require more a/c. We also need 2 new mixers, valued at $3500 each and a $1300 commercial stove.   We plan to open satellite locations in high foot-traffic areas that will have a low overhead (rent/payroll)and just receive our morning deliveries for sales.  This will increase our overall output in our main location and boost sales/profits.   So join us and one day you will remember being a lender to a company that had a global vision and made it happen!

This debt resulted from three key factors: Ã¢â¬Â¢	The Primary cause was sending our son to college, the initial cost of setting up housing,   application fees, and visits to potential schools exceeded our monthly budget.  His ongoing expenses are covered by his scholarship so this was a onetime impact. Ã¢â¬Â¢	Our aging pet brought on the unexpected need to replace our carpeting this summer. We opted for tile to maximize our investment. This was not a planed expense and was charged to a credit card. Ã¢â¬Â¢	Several years ago we accumulated credit card debt from higher monthly expenses, transferring a car loan, and home Improvements. We have been paying this debt down by transferring to different low rate cards while exceeding the minimum monthly payments. My goal is to pay off all debt and pay one bill. Transferring balances is not as cost effective as it used to be and I would rather just simplify.  Income:  I am a Sr manager in workforce management. I specialize in call center forecasting and long term planning. I have been in my field for 10+ years. I currently work for a large bank but my job skills are easily transferred to any call center business both domestically or offshore.  Ability and motivation to repay: My monthly expenses are below my income. I currently pay over the minimum monthly payments and will have no problem meeting the obligation of this loan payment. I have eight years left to pay on my mortgage and have a lot of equity on my home. I could easily borrow against it but I donÃ¢â¬â¢t want to draw against my investment. I plan to stay in my home and look forward to a debt free life.   I understand that the low rate on this loan may deter some investors that are looking for a higher return.  I do plan to pay this loan to its full term and not pay  off the loan early. My goal is to place the extra funds in savings to avoid the need for debt in the future.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

Our loan grade of E1 obviously signals risk, but here are a few reasons why this loan is all reward and no risk for you:  <br/><br/>1. We make a very solid stable income, as I mentioned before, my income has been verified above at over $9.6K a month, but what isn't factored into that number is that my wife brings in almost half of that number $4.3K, bringing our monthly gross income to over $13K, it is almost $9.5K NET with expenses that barely touch $7.5K with this loan repayment figure factored in.<br/><br/>2. We currently do not use credit cards at all...this revolving debt comes from a period in our lives when we were finishing college and starting our family, our credit profile is not an accurate depiction of our current situation.<br/><br/>3. We have never missed a payment for anything and I am not about to start, we crave the automation and the simplistic nature of being able to have one payment that is static, it will allow us to save in excess of $15K - $20K a year, some of which can be translated into quicker loan repayment.<br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration of our loan, and thank you to all of the investors that are already guranteed to make an ROI with this investment.<br/> Borrower added on 12/09/10 > Thank you to everyone who has invested in our loan, you have made a great decision and we wont let you down, get ready to make some money!<br/>",debt_consolidation,Thomas Consolidation Loan,201xx,VA,8.94,0.0,Feb-1990,0.0,46.0,,7.0,0.0,8177,51.5,19.0,f,0.0,0.0,30825.7700193556,30643.58,21150.0,9675.77,0.0,0.0,0.0,Dec-2015,513.34,,Sep-2016,0.0,,1,Individual,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cash,N,,,,,,

I am 33 years old, divorced and have a secure job that provides me with a net income of $3480 per month.  I purchased a home in November 2008 and owe $105,000.  I recently had an appraisal completed and it showed a home value of $110,000.  I do not have a HELOC on this home.  I am very fortunate to be provided a company vehicle, for work and personal use, so my personal car is for sale and priced well.  I anticipate selling it quickly, which would leave me without a payment and required insurance.  Currently, my monthly budget is:<br/><br/>Cable/Internet/Home Phone	$30.00 <br/>Personal Car Insurance	$68.00<br/>Personal Car Payment	$340.00<br/>Cell Phone	$65.00<br/>Groceries/Household	$350.00<br/>Mortgage	$925.00<br/>Utilities	$125.00<br/>	$1,903.00 <br/>	<br/><br/>The debts that I intend to pay off with the debt consolidation loan are: <br/><br/>Card Name               Balance         APR	        Monthly Payment<br/>Citi	                         $5,240.48 	22.90%	$150.00<br/>American Express	 $5,472.96 	15.24%	 $700.00-$1000.00<br/>Chase	                 $7,057.35 	11.24%	$126.00<br/>FIA	                         $6,905.33 	11.99%	$137.00<br/><br/>The total monthly minimum credit card payment I incur is $1113-$1413 per month.  Including minimum credit card payments, my monthly expenses are $3050-$3350.  As you can see, there is not a lot of wiggle room for emergency or miscellaneous expenses.  In essence, I can only afford to make the minimum monthly payments and that simply isn&rsquo;t good enough for me.  I truly believe in being debt free and would greatly appreciate a chance to get ahead of the game.  A debt consolidation loan would provide me this opportunity.  I would be able to decrease my monthly payments and secure a savings cushion.  I depleted most of my savings to pay towards debt.  <br/><br/>While all unsecured debts are being paid and once they are paid in full, I will be and will remain fully committed to living debt free. I have no doubt that I will be able to pay this loan in full and on time each and every month!

What are you doing to keep this debt from reoccurring? thank you --Sent at: Nov 24 2010 07:57:28 PST<br/><br/>Answer:<br/>When I answered the previous question about my monthly bills, I listed the monthly credit card payment as it would be after getting this loan.  I am currently paying $750 per month towards credit card debt and $620 per month on car loans.  I plan on using this loan to pay off one car loan which has a balance of $11,500 with a monthly payment of $400.  I will use $9500 to pay off the highest interest rate credit card (which Citibank decided to change my rate to 30% for no reason other than they could).   That should free up around $300 per month.  The remainder will pay towards a lower rate credit card at 13.9%.  With this loan I will have a $510 monthly payment plus one car loan payment at $220 and finally $350 will go towards two credit cards with balances of $8500 and $5500 each.  The total of these will be $1080 instead of the $1370 that I am currently paying.  By freeing up $290 per month, I will be able to pay more towards the two remaining credit cards, and hopefully get out of debt sooner than later.<br/><br/>As for the house, I only have one mortgage on my house.  The balance is $313,175.  The monthly payment (including escrow) is $1900.  The last appraisal (approximately one year ago) was $358,000.<br/><br/>As for keeping the debt from reoccurring&hellip; A portion of the debt has come from using credit cards to pay the routine stuff (gas, groceries, etc.) and not paying off the balance every month.  Sadly to say it took about 8 years to figure out this wasn&rsquo;t working.  About 2 years ago we made a change.  We switched to a cash system and no longer use credit cards to make purchases.  <br/><br/>Another large part of the debt has come from poor decisions regarding a house we purchased in 2005.  At that time the housing market had been doing really well for years.  We moved with a job change, bought a house on the high end of our budget and made substantial improvement to the house that amounted to around $25,000.  When we moved just over a year ago and sold the house, we got back what we originally paid for the house, but all of the improvements were a loss.  When we made the decision to do this in 2005, recent history was telling us that we would get back everything we put into the house and could possibly make money.  As with many others that thought the same, it did not turn out as planned.<br/><br/>I realize that I put my self in this situation, but I am working my way out of it.  I want to pay off what I owe and put this chapter of debt behind me.  By getting this loan, it will give me some traction to pull my way out of this hole.

I appreciate your help and look forward to being in your shoes soon. Thank you.<br/> Borrower added on 11/09/10 > Lending Club, <br/>As I wait for my listing to post this evening, I thought it would be prudent to proactively answer some common questions you may have prior to deciding to fund this note.  This is obviously an investment on your end and I want to make you as comfortable as possible regarding the following items:  my compensation structure/job security, current debt obligations, monthly expenses/budget, and my regimented plan to become completely debt-free.  As I mentioned in my initial description, I plan to be in your shoes once this loan is paid back in full.<br/>&bull;	What is AmWINS Group Inc.? What is your job title and what are your duties? <br/>I work for the largest property and casualty wholesale brokerage firm in the U.S.  I have been with them for a total of 5 years (including an internship while in college) and really enjoy my job.  <br/>My current title is Producer (Broker) and I specialize in the Healthcare Industry.  I facilitate/negotiate the essential property and casualty insurance products that hospitals must purchase in order to protect themselves so they can provide us care when we need it. My career is going very well and I certainly have no intention of going anywhere.  To be honest, I&rsquo;d like to retire from here years down the road!<br/>My compensation structure is salary-based with potential for an annual bonus.  I have provided my monthly income (based on salary only) and will try to figure out how to verify that with LC today to increase your comfort level. <br/>&bull;	What debt obligations do you currently have (please provide balances, interest rates) and which debts do you intend to pay off with this loan? <br/>Mastercard - $7,000 @ 16.99%<br/>Visa - $3,000 @ 9.99%<br/>I will pay off each of these amounts in full upon this note being fully funded.  <br/>&bull;	Can you list your monthly itemized expenses and their amounts? <br/>Rent - $600 per month<br/>Car Payment - $206 per month<br/>The only other monthly expenses are utilities, groceries, gas, etc.<br/>&bull;	Monthly Budget <br/>Gross Income = $5,000 <br/>Net Income = $3,400 (after taxes, benefits costs, etc.)<br/>&bull;	My Plan (with your help!)<br/>Once I receive the $10k loan from my investor(s), I will eliminate the debt I currently have the high interest rate.  While my recent salary increase has certainly assisted me in working towards eliminating debt and building a foundation for my future, I just can&rsquo;t justify continuing to pay the interest rates associated with each CC.  My credit score and history have allowed me to work with each of you at a rate that would be unintelligent to pass up.  <br/>The monthly payment was calculated at $306.67 per month, but I will be putting $500 towards the loan amount each month.  I know this will cut the loan term a bit short and that will affect your total money earned, but you will be making a financially-sound decision.  On another note, you would really be helping me become established and allow me to look forward to the exciting next steps in my life (engagement ring, home purchase, etc.).  With a planned payment of $500 each month, I will have this completely paid off by September 2012 and then be in the position to help someone else out.

I believe that this is the quickest way to crawl out of the debt due to the one payment a month and the consolidation of my debt.  I currently take home approx $3,500/month net (single with no children).  After the above payments are made that leaves me with $2,800 in which $800 of that would go to pay this loan every month- I am 100% confident in being able to pay this loan off.  I have been in my current position for the past 4 years and have no doubt in my job stability.  I am trying to crawl out of this debt as soon as possible so that I could begin saving.  Please feel free to ask me any additional questions as I will be more than happy to respond.

In addition, last January we hired three people full time as a marketing department.

We initially made this move in order to take us away from yellow page advertising. It has been incredibly successful this past year however, to the extent that we estimate we were understaffed by 25-40%. We are expanding our business to meet the demand that we have had this past year as well as to meet the additional demand which these new relationships (contracts) will have. We are financing most of the expansion ourselves but are looking for additional funds to bridge the gap. We currently have approximately $150,000 in existing debt.

I currently pay over 500.00 a month on that card to accelerate paying it off so my new loan payment will be easily met and the difference will be applied on other debt.  I have full custody of my 15 year old son and I receive Social Security Disability payments on his behalf from my ex-wife.  My son will no longer be eligible for benefits when he turns 18.  I have created a budget to pay off all of my credit card debt in the next 3 years before my son turns 18.  I have a good stable job as a computer programmer professional.  I have been in the IT industry for 24 years.   If you have any questions, please dont hesitate to ask.  Thank you very much.   One Inquiry was a Discover Personal loan that I wanted to use to pay off my Chase Credit card and one other card but the rate they were offering was not very good so I declined the offer.  The other inquiry was because I was looking into refinancing my home.  The difference in what I was paying did not make sense here either     The one delinquency happened because My Chase Credit Card due date changed from the 4th of the following month to the the last day of current month.  I pay my bills on line and never looked at the bill that was sent which also had the information that my due date was changing.   So I paid my bill on the 1st of the month and was informed that I was 20 hours late and my rate was jumping to 17.24%.  I tried to fight it but did not succeed.  I will never do business with Chase again.      Much of my current debt is attributed to my ex-wife.  She is bi-polar and a spend-a-holic.  I do not pay her anything in the divorce settlement but I did become responsible for all of her (our) debt.  I have paid down 20,000 since March 2010 when I sold my house and bought a condo for me and my son.      I am a detailed person and will list my current monthly expenses.

I have a very loyal client following, enjoy my work very much and plan to continue working in my current capacity until I retire.  I take my financial responsibilities seriously and have never defaulted on a loan.<br/><br/>I purchased a foreclosed property this past summer.  The property is a fenced acre with a double wide manufactured home on it.  Manufactured homes are very common in this part of the country.  The well and septic system were inspected prior to purchase and found to be in good condition but the home itself is in need of repair.  The property was initially purchased with the intention of selling the manufactured home and purchasing a modular home to be installed on the property.  At the same time I had the home I am currently living in on the real estate market.  My intention was to sell my home and use the proceeds to pay off debt and have cash on hand for emergencies.  By doing this and moving into a less expensive modular home (on the foreclosed property) I would be reducing my monthly mortgage payment as well as my total mortgage debt amount substantially.<br/><br/>I had a buyer lined up for the manufactured home but shortly before he purchased it there was a death in his family and he could no longer proceed with the purchase..... more to follow<br/> Borrower added on 11/04/10 > ...I began to feel that a new opportunity was presenting itself.  My current mortgage on that property is below $300. per month.  The mortgage is a land loan so I actually own the manufactured home outright.  If my husband and I were able to renovate the manufactured home ourselves we would be living in a nice home on a desirable piece of land for a very small monthly mortgage.  Really when you think about it, less than $300. per month is almost like living for free.  The renovation loan would be paid off relatively quickly (as compared with a mortgage) so in a few years our only debt would be a small mortgage and possibly a car payment.<br/><br/>I am a conservative spender.  In spite of this I have credit card debt.  My goal is to pay it off with the sale of my current house.  The reason for much of that debt is twofold.  My husband has had many health problems.  The cost of medical procedures and medications has been significant.  In addition, it has also resulted in gaps in his employment that have obviously resulted in less income.  He was also laid off from his job about 8 months ago after a massive downsizing (aobut 80% of his coworkers lost their jobs) in his department.  His health has improved greatly over the last few months and he has returned to school and is due to graduate in about 2 months.  I expect he will earn a reasonable salary once he graduates.  He has had 2 different employers approach him about a job after he graduates.<br/>",home_improvement,redneck repair,870xx,NM,12.86,1.0,Nov-1998,0.0,18.0,,10.0,0.0,13815,22.6,32.0,f,0.0,0.0,12669.3416891576,12363.86,11200.0,1469.35,0.0,0.0,0.0,Jun-2013,6101.76,,Feb-2017,0.0,,1,Individual,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cash,N,,,,,,

Compared to many of my colleagues my age, this is relatively small - many of them have loans upwards of $100K! I took out my student loans in order to cover my living expenses that were not covered by scholarship while I was in graduate school for business and arts administration. My undergrad education was completely paid for / covered by scholarships. I have been out of school and working for 2 years now.<br/><br/>I have two jobs, one full time job with a salary of $40K, and one part-time job with a salary of $10K.

While I could use the later towards my credit card debt, I would prefer to keep it in case of emergency. <br/><br/>I accumulated my credit card debt over the last five years during small gaps of unemployment and times of relocation. Neither of these things are factors any more, as I have been in the same job for a year and a half now, and am happily situated in a small one bedroom apartment in New York. Living in New York keeps me from contributing as much to my credit cards as I'd like. <br/><br/>In five years time I may or may not still be in New York, but I plan to have paid off this loan and be credit card debt free!

I also have an Investment Advisor license (although not currently active) and have money management experience.  I have also generated a full income for six months by day-trading stocks.<br/><br/>With regards to my request for the loan, I have uncovered an opportunity writing &quot;insurance&quot; contracts where I can make a 5%-7% monthly return with 95% probability of success.  The idea is to find a situation where you are compensated adequately for taking the risk.  Combine this with a mathematical formula of capital allocation that ensures bad luck does not cause financial ruin and you have a winning play.  This opportunity was uncovered by months of extensive analysis of a historical database.<br/><br/>I have such strong conviction in this opportunity that I am willing to borrow money on my personal credit to start it.  If this sounds like a pitch, that is the intent -- this opportunity is very scalable and can employ significant amounts of capital.  In addition, it serves an economic purpose, which is distribution of risk.  This allows revenues to be created at will, as long as the amount of capital is available.<br/><br/>I want to start this with $10,000 and execute it for a few months before evaluating whether to grow it further. At that time, I would then expand the business by employing more capital either by borrowing or taking on investors.  Please feel free to ask me questions.<br/><br/>Thanks!<br/> Borrower added on 10/28/10 > Additional Info:  I will not be quiting my job as that is the primary source of my income.

My future looks very bright; I'm a young professional and already cannot ask for a better start of my young career. I'm working as a Branch Manager for a reputable organization and I'm on my way to become a AVP of my financial instituition. I can easily afford to make the payments on my loan without any financial sacrifice. After getting married, my spouse will be bringing in additional income that will be beneficial on paying this loan not only on time but rather faster as well. My fiance and I have lived an independant life on the most part, and are trying to embark on our wedding journey without any financial support from either of our parents. Its not that we can't, but we take great pride in becoming &quot;self-made&quot; and it gives us a humbling feeling of being financial savvy, and have been successful so far in our lives.<br/> Borrower added on 10/30/10 > Great News! Lending Club credit department has approved my loan request. So this further proves that financially I can easily afford to repay this loan! So please please please investors, help me out and lets try to fund this loan to 100%. I will be forever greatful! Thank you to everyone who has invested in my loan so far.<br/> Borrower added on 10/31/10 > Marrying my fiance will be my ultimate dream come to reality. If you (investors) have any questions please feel free to ask me. I would be glad to answer your questions, so that my funding volume can keep increasing. At this rate, it looks unlikely that I'd be able to reach my target goal. Once again, I thank all the investors who have contributed towards my funding, and urge the remaining to please do the same. Thank you!<br/> Borrower added on 11/08/10 > Less than a day left, folks! I hope someone is out there that can contribute a chunk of their investing money towards the funding of my loan. There is no question about my ability to pay back, as Lending Club Credit Dept. has approved me for the loan amount. So please, I urge and request to help me reach my goal... And thank you again to all who have contributed towards my funding so far.

I&rsquo;d like to introduce myself and explain the purpose of my loan. I&rsquo;m 33 years old and have been paying bills since I was 18. I have never made a late payment on any credit card, car loan, rent, etc. I am not married nor do I have children. I have a great job at a mortgage company that is close to home and has full medical benefits. I&rsquo;ve been working there for six and a half years, the company has been in business for 28 years. You can see their website at www.mountainmortgagecorp.com.<br/><br/>I have a very small monthly budget. Rent $893, Phone and Internet $70, Electric $50, Gas $20, Car Insurance $120, Food $130, Credit Cards $150, Miscellaneous $30. This all totals $1463.<br/><br/>The purpose of my loan is to help me start a side business. I have been a computer programmer since I got out of high school and for the last few years I've been programming game engines for all the major independent gaming platforms (Xbox, Iphone, Android, Blackberry, Symbian, Windows Phone 7, Google, PC, Mac) so I can tap into the booming independent games market. My engines are complete for a number of games with place holder art. The money I wish to borrow would be used for a few different things. First to pay professional artists and musicians to add high quality art and music to the games. To purchase the proper equipment to fully test all the games on all the platforms and operating systems. To pay for professional advertising and viral marketing campaigns. And finally to add professional content to my e-commerce website which will promote/sell the games and merchandise. I'm taking this side business very seriously. This loan amount would cover everything I need to create a very professional presence and ensure quality recognition in the future. If I get this loan quickly I'll have a few of the games out before December and be able to take advantage of all the extra purchases made during the Holiday Season. I think that about covers it. But should anyone have any other questions, please feel free to ask. Thanks!<br/><br/>P.S. I read that it is better to be proactive on the Credit Review Status so I called Lending Club today and asked if there is anything I can do to speed up the process. Their representative told me there wasn't and that I just had to wait for the Credit Review team to get to my file. I hope they get to it soon.

This loan is for a property/business purchase in New Zealand. My wife and I are interested in purchasing a working vineyard on the North Island, outside of Wellington in the Wairarapa Valley. We already have an offer for funding from a major NZ bank, who have done their due dilligence and found us to be of excellent quality.  However, NZ banks lend for agribusiness ventures such as this only on the value of the land and not on the value of the grapes, trellises, etc. My wife and I have about 25% of the total value of the land saved up, and the bank is offering another 50%, so we're looking for this loan to put us over the hump in terms of the downpayment necessary.   This is exactly the time to enter the NZ wine industry, because it's hit its trough in terms of oversupply (in Sauv Blanc) and has undergone a major consolidation. Moreover, the vineyard is planted with 5.68 hectares of pinot noir and pinot gris, two grape varieties that have withstood downward price pressure throughout the global recession.  Additionally, this particular vineyard is a buy now because: <br/>1. the vineyard is already working, has been for 10 years <br/>2. the vineyard has management contracts with an established winery, who will look after the grapes and return a profit on the purchase price of the grapes (estimated at about $20,000US per year, or nearly the cost of this loan!) <br/>3. interest rates are of course at rock bottom <br/>4. the winery this is attached to is known for highly rated wines in a niche market (for example, Gourmet Traveller rates their pinot noir at 97 points out of 100) and is actually looking to expand (hence why they're selling off the vineyards, to raise capital for the winery itself). They have seen sales increase during the recession, and are well-situated to take advantage of global recovery. Basically, they will continue to buy these grapes well into the future.  Anyway, my wife and I have more than enough income flow to cover payments for this vineyard - I work for a major international organization and make approximately $182,000 per annum - but we need slightly more stock for the downpayment (we were surprised that the NZ banks would only lend 50% of land value, which ended up just about being 40% of the total price). Also, the NZ dollar has been plummeting versus the US dollar lately (so long as the Dow is down), so every dollar invested in this goes a lot farther for us.

After several years of making great music together, he surprised me with a beautiful wedding proposal in Concord, Massachusetts at the Old North Bridge (the seat of the country's birth, and for me a Revolutionary War and Little Women aficionado, and for him, the setting of his current opera on the New England transcendentalists--a thrilling experience).  The fourteen months since that wonderful weekend have been, if nothing else, an adventure. We have since moved to Concord where he is getting a master's and doctorate in Music Therapy and working as a behavioral therapist with autistic children. And I have started a new business in early childhood music education and am also working as a massage therapist.  Although we are planning a simple wedding in the woods in California, it is very much do-it-yourself, including all the financing, as well as being planned from across the country.

I don't agree with the personal injury contingency approach to settling an accident claim.  <br/>I need one now to file suit and to provide advice on a few key issues because of the push-back Iâm getting.  I have no intention of going to court, but I do expect to go to mediation. <br/><br/>I believe the claim is worth at least $100,000 and perhaps more.  Why do I believe that now?  From the research Iâve done and because of the Neurosurgeon report that will say that the  surgery is necessary.<br/><br/>Use of funds:  To cover attorney fees, filing fees, doctor's statements and mediation.  <br/><br/>Source of Repayment:  When the claim settles.<br/><br/>I will include a copy of the last offer from the insurance company to the Lending Club folks along with income information.  I am also willing to have a lien placed on the claim.<br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration.<br/>",other,Pre-Insurance Settlement Funding,760xx,TX,21.89,0.0,Jun-1979,0.0,,,9.0,0.0,86016,81.2,17.0,f,0.0,0.0,8083.020000000006,7837.65,6123.6,1711.41,30.970478179763997,217.04,2.88,Dec-2012,151.67,,Oct-2016,0.0,,1,Individual,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cash,N,,,,,,

I carry some credit card debt with interest rates that range from 7.00% - 19.24%. Some of these rates have been arbitrarily increased over the past six to nine months so I am hoping to refinance into a lower weighted average rate as well. I am also a Lending Club Lender and I like the idea of paying interest to other lenders with a known payment and rate. Readers should note that I do have over $41,000 invested in the market and would like to keep that in place to take advantage of the stock market's recent uptick and ongoing dividend payments. However, that could be used to repay this loan if necessary.     <br/><br/>My financial situation: I have been steadily employed by the same firm for over seven years and I have a reliable stream of income. I have never been late on any payments and, as a fellow lender, I certainly understand the value of reliable cash flow. Not including an annual discretionary bonus that typically ranges from $10,000 - $35,000, I gross about $7,150 and net about $4,500 after deducting for taxes, insurance and all retirement. I live with my girlfriend and so fixed expenses are relatively low at about $600.00 per month. This includes auto-$350.00, auto insurance-$50.00 and my share of utilities, etc.-$200.00. I do not pay rent or mortgage as I am trying to become debt free before getting married. The difference in income of $3,900 goes toward debt repayment and discretionary spending which varies month to month.

But please answer these two questions first please:<br/><br/><br/>1. Do you hold the title to your home on *your own name*<br/><br/><br/>2. How much equity do you have on your house? (please provide the home valuation and total balance of the mortgage/heloc loans)<br/><br/>Member_595101, Thank you for your question and possible financing.  To answer your questions, my home loan is in my husband and my name and is currently $127,299 with $747,00 of the $1,585 going to the principle.  We have been paying on the loan for 15 years give or take a year, and refinanced mainly to lower the years of the loan.  The property was last valued at $575,000 several years ago but that was before the crash.  We can still get at least $300,000-$400,000 concervatively.  I have set aside $900.00 in my bank account provided which is sperate from the family budget in order to pay the monthly payments.  Sorry for the delay in answering your question.  Have a nice day.<br/> Borrower added on 06/03/10 > In the notes section, lending club suggests to offer information regarding on how I will pay back this loan, stable employment, what makes me a good borrower, and monthly budget.<br/><br/>Stable Employment:  I started working at 15 Â½ and have only been unemployed once in my life.  I was laid off due to a buyout of my employer, a major financial institution.  At that time it was good news since a severance package afforded me to stay home with my new baby, as well a return to college for a Microsoft Certification Program. I received my MCSE certification and began working for an IT Company where I worked for 9 Â½ years.  During the 9 Â½ years I moved up the chain and eventually transferred to an account that supported the City.  I was promoted to Network/Server Manager but transferred to my current position when there was an opening.  So realistically, I have been at this current location for over 11 years.  Five years doesnât sound very creditable.<br/> <br/>Good Borrower:  For years I had a credit rating of over 820-840s, and want it back.  I allowed myself to be unselfish and naive to loan funds that were never repaid.  I just want this debt paid off and plan to look into helping others through this type of funding.  What a great opportunity.<br/><br/>Monthly Budget:  I have set aside $450.00 bi-monthly which will cover this payment.  <br/><br/>How will I use this loan:  It will be used to consolidate my credit cards and I will be able to pay a lower interest rate, which can be paid off in 3 years.<br/><br/>Thank you!!<br/>",debt_consolidation,Consolidate SZ8J4F,917xx,CA,11.72,3.0,Aug-1986,0.0,3.0,,15.0,0.0,32169,60.9,24.0,f,0.0,0.0,21168.216336800902,20808.95,18150.0,3018.22,0.0,0.0,0.0,Nov-2011,2775.21,,Nov-2018,0.0,,1,Individual,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cash,N,,,,,,

On the day this loan request was created (5/24) and as my screen name suggests, my FICO Score with TransUnion was 715.  My timely payments in excess of the minimum due each month have not been enough to keep my interest rates at a reasonable level.  While I have been consistently on time with my payments to Citibank, my interest rate has risen to 29.990%.  The majority of my monthly payments (approximately 80%) are now absorbed by high finance charges rather than paying off my actual balance.<br/><br/>I am a successful district manager for Limited Brands' Bath & Body Works division.  More than 1600 stores in the United States and we are expanding into Canada and have a few overseas locations.  I love what I do, have a college degree in my field with no tuition debt, and am so thankful to be gainfully employed in this still difficult environment.    I have been with the company for nearly ten years and have been promoted several times over the past 5 years.  Getting promoted is not just about successful results, it's also about mobility.  I have moved for my job 6 times since 2002, which has been great because all moves have meant more money and greater responsibility.  Even though I received relocation assistance for 3 of the 6 moves, it always involves more money than you get.  The other 3 moves I did voluntarily to be closer to my territory, but with no financial assistance.  The additional out of pocket needs have slowly crept up on me in the form of high credit card debt. <br/><br/>On July 1, 2010 I am moving yet again.  This is an exciting time, albeit an expensive move as my new district is Boston, Massachusetts proper.  This recent promotion brings with it a raise in salary and a company vehicle.  I plan to use this additional income to aggressively pay off my debt and will continue to work to improve my financial situation.  I want nothing more than to pay off this credit card debt and say goodbye to exorbitantly high interest rates. <br/><br/>I think it is genius to have a forum where I can put some money into someone's pocket in return for a loan that will help me get rid of the plastic debt!  <br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration and rest assured I am a worthwhile and sound investment.<br/> Borrower added on 05/28/10 > Additional notes:<br/>I have never defaulted on a loan or financial obligation.  I want to add an additional note to alleviate any potential concerns investors may have about my ability to repay the loan here on Lending Club.<br/><br/>In the unlikely event that I found myself unemployed and without a steady stream of income, I would borrow against my 401k retirement account to pay back my loan here on Lending Club.  As of today (5-28) I have $90,000 between my 401k/savings retirement account.  <br/><br/>Thanks again for considering me as your next investment.<br/>",debt_consolidation,Goodbye High Interest Credit Cards!!!,015xx,MA,7.78,2.0,Nov-1989,0.0,15.0,,10.0,0.0,20270,48.7,15.0,f,0.0,0.0,24368.0799789596,24166.12,16275.0,8093.08,0.0,0.0,0.0,Jun-2015,430.98,,Aug-2018,0.0,,1,Individual,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cash,N,,,,,,

In addition to this I recently took a part time teaching adjunct position that will increase my salary at minimum by $11,400- and will increase if/when I opt to teach more than 2 classes per quarter. That is why I am confident that this loan will be repayed within my 3 year goal period of time, if not sooner! Thank you all again for your consideration! You may be asking yourself why I would even consider doing this loan then, well the answer is: I am not going to repay Citibank with my loyalty after they triple my interest rate after having been an excellent customer for 10 years! I believe in people who do the right thing being rewarded, and they flat out refused to change their ridiculous rates. I would rather provide an interest/return for investors than for a bank who is poorly managing their customers money, and over-debting customers who may have no intention of repaying their debt.

I have been in business for five years and in related fields for ten more.  My specialties include the maintenance of computer networks, internet access, and email systems; software and hardware troubleshooting; data backups; and data recovery from damaged hard drives.  I also utilize the latest technology for remote troubleshooting and can take control of client computers within seconds of a request.  I am very technically informed and receive daily several hundred confidential internal emails within the Apple Consultants Network that inform me of up-to-the-minute problems that other consultants are encountering at customer locations throughout the U.S.  I also monitor a dozen third-party technical sites covering countless issues as they occur.  For the last five years I have been going solo and have been too busy to take on new customers, but an opportunity has presented itself to take on someone with whom I’ve worked in the past who has the perfect technical expertise.  Toward this end I’ve just purchased another cargo van (that I will turn into a mobile information technology center) and I’d started to buy equipment using some special-rate credit card offers when I realized that—as silly as this may sound, as I just signed up to be a lender—I can borrow at a better rate over a longer period of time from LendingClub.com.  I still need to purchase a laptop, desktop, diagnostic software, hardware, communication equipment, storage racks for the van, switches, routers, and network cabling for inventory as well as certification classes for my new employee.  I also read many local, regional, and international newspapers daily, uncovering gems like LendingClub.com and recently noticed they have a program to trade promissory notes with FolioFN.com—another brilliant investment vehicle.

I am a divorced father who shares joint legal custody for two daughters who are ages 6 and 9.  I'm also an active duty major in the U.S. Army and a recent MBA graduate from George Mason University.  I need to retain the services of a skilled lawyer to litigate for more favorable visitation terms, as I'll explain.  My girls have their primary residence with their mother (my ex) 1,000 miles away.  I fly out to see them every 6 weeks during the school year, and they visit me for two three-week periods during the summer.  My girls originally accompanied my ex to Missouri when she mobilized with the U.S. Army Reserve.  I lost the injunction to keep them with me in Northern Virginia during the period of mobilization.  My ex's argument was that, while mobilized, her job would be that of a classroom instructor, and having the girls accompany her would preserve the status quo (she was a stay-at-home mom before our divorce).  The judge agreed.  My ex has since demobilized, but has elected to make Missouri her permanent home.  That means there's been a material change in circumstance, so I've filed a motion to secure an enduring custody & visitation agreement.  My chief goal is to expand summer visitation to 8 continuous weeks so I can get the girls into activities near my home and do all the daddy/daughter things I miss out on during the rest of the year.  I'm also going to challenge my ex on her attempts at parental alienation.  I am a career Army officer; I'll be promoted to lieutenant colonel in February, so my future income is assured.

I'm currently consulting on various small businesses that are taking their business online to maximize their sales.  ABOUT STARTUPSNAX:  StartupSnax.com, the provider of Daily Munchables for  Your Business, is a small business resource site centered around providing current and edgy content for the web 2.0/social media & networking entrepreneurial environment and to help anyone looking for a current site to find information on how to start their business cost-effectively (how about under $10,000?), time-efficiently (maybe in a matter of weeks?) and resourcefully (how do I make sure my business is green?).  WHAT DO WE OFFER?  With the resources of the industries keynote authors on various topics, we will be offering:  - StartupSnax Blog - StartupSnax Free Stuff! - StartupSnax Ebook Store - StartupSnax RSS Feed and Newsletter  The authors of these ebooks are major industry writers that will be using their current substantial sales platforms (their websites, speaking engagements, newsletters, radio events, online blogs and webinars, book signings, and various other PR opportunities, etc) to direct traffic towards our site in addition to our online marketing, SEO and online traffic efforts. They will be using the site as a marketing vehicle for their various works and expertise.   HOW DO YOU MAKE MONEY?  Ebooks:  Ebooks have been increasing in YTD (past year to date) sales more than any other product in the publishing industry! Publishers Weekly (www.PublishersWeekly.com) has been quoting that although various in-store sales have been down over previous YTD sales, ebooks have been continuing to increase with the lowest overhead and highest profit margins! Better yet, trade ebook sales (business, not fiction) have been doing well despite the hardcopies' decrease in sales due to the economic slump.  Fortunately, since we are only offering these professionally-edited, written and designed ebooks in digital format, we are saving the cost of printing them, and staying GREEN as well!  By offering smaller (snackable!) ebooks in a condensed format by major authors similar to the Cliff Notes for small business and offering these ebooks at an impressive price point of less than $10, by maximizing traffic, we are sure of substantial ebook sales numbers based upon industry trends.   Ad Sales:  We have not calculated the inevitable ad revenue that will be garnered from providing a pivotal ebook store and resource site into our breakeven analysis but it is a buffer to ensure that we are profitable in the first two months.  WHY DO YOU NEED A LOAN?  A loan is a buffer for guaranteed success. Each person and company should have an emergency fund of at least three months' worth of working capital especially in this economy. Although we could  launch without a loan, although difficult, we are ensuring the success of a solid business plan in the case of a substantial interest in the company at the launch and the need for fast growth.  My credit is exceptional and this is not my only form of income since I'm also consulting, but I always advise my clients that cash is king! In the effort to keep the marketing budget at its peak, I need a loan to ensure those efforts. Also, the ebooks are being professionally copyedited and designed for ideal quality and I'm utilizing an industry leader as a production editor.  WHAT CAN I SEE NOW?  You can view the parked page at www.StartupSnax.com.  Our blog goes live mid November with a final site launch slated for January 1st!

I have always paid my bills on time and have had low debt, along with a great credit rating for the majority of my life. However, my current high debt is a reflection of a 4 year period when I attended college, paying tuition, books and such.  As a result, I am only indebted to my credit cards. I did not obtain tuition loans. Also, I do not have a car loan or any other debt, just my credit cards.           For the past 2 years, due to an increase in income, I have been able to pay a substantial amount of my debt off.  If you look at my credit report, you can see that I have no delinquent accounts and that I have paid off over $13000 of my debt these past 2 years. At this point, I would like to minimize my interest rate fees in order to contribute more to the principal.Furthermore, I have closed the credit cards that I plan to pay with this loan, which are listed in  my credit report. I have no problem identifying those credit cards and agreeing to a formal agreement to that.                   I would just like to quickly pay all of my credit cards then close all but one of them.

As it has turned out, I was a little too eager to pay off this Lending Club loan.

My wife owns a Real Estate company and last year was a very slow year for her. Her business is finally picking up, due to the fact that we live in North Carolina which is such a growing area, so we haven't felt the pressures of other Real Estate markets, but we seem to be playing catch up with our credit card debt. We have already paid off several credit cards (and we have removed them from our wallets), however with these last three even though we are sending more than the minimum amount required, it seems that a large part goes towards interest and they just don't seem to be going down. We have good credit and are homeowner's. If we could consolidate these debts and have a more manageable payment we would be able to pay off the loan easily just with our salaries.

My mentor/manager asked me to help cover some advertising costs by using my CC.  He failed to deliver on his promises to pay it off swiftly.  Several years later,  I seldom  hear from him.  So paying this off fully, not just covering the minimum payment, is my responsibility and personal mission.  My credit card company cannot reduce my rate b/c I voluntarily shut the card down a few years ago.  They suggest that I go through their debt managemtent solution to set up a plan.  But I can't go to a 'Debt Modification' arrangement b/c I'm in the financial services industry, and that would be a problem for future job disclosure forms, etc.  So I am looking to get ahead of my interest payments, so as to actually begin reducing the principal significantly.  By having a lower rate, the $500-700/month for this loan will dramatically increase the proportion of my payment which is paying down principal.   My financial situation:  I am a good candidate for this loan because my take home pay varies b/t 2,500 and 3,500 per month due to various components of my pay structure.  One component is an override from my entire office's revenue [that began in Oct 07], due to my integral involvement with many other associates' accounts.  After my job change in 2005, aroundthe same time as Hurricane Katrina, my income took a big hit.  But over the last 2+ year it has increased nearly 50% each year.  As thing are today, I am on pace to make at least $40,000 gross in 2008.  Any new accounts/clients/revenue are on top of this $40,000 income base.  My expenses are fairly low considering.  No car payment, low rent, gas is taken care of.  And ultimately, as a Certified Financial Planner, I would never allow my own finances to go into default or bankruptcy because my career would be finished.  I want to get this monkey off my back ASAP, and a lower rate loan would enable my to get financially fit much, much faster.

It's a large (over 1200 square feet), walkout basement with lots of natural light.  It's just begging to be a more usable area.  I want to add 2 bedrooms, a bath room (the rough-in is already present), a living area, kitchenette (microwave, fridge, and cabinets), and a room that could be used as either an office, exercise room, or spare bedroom.  I am moving into the house at the end of May and want to have the basement finished by the end of the summer.  I'm a math professor, which means that I can work from home some in the summer and have more flexibility with my schedule than I can during the fall and spring semesters.  Thus, I'm trying hard to get this taken care of this summer.  I'm single, and I prefer to have housemates instead of living alone.  I posted an ad on Craigslist looking for other young professionals with whom to share.  It seems that there are a lot of us who prefer to share housing, and I have had a lot of interest.  Thus, after I finish the basement, I plan to rent it to other young professionals.  My calculations indicate that this investment will pay for itself in about 4 years.   Of course, it will also increase the value of the home.  About me:  I finished graduate school a year ago, with a Ph.D. in math.  I'm now a math professor, which means that I do research in mathematics and teach math courses to undergraduates.  I am heavily involved in the mathematical education of teachers.  I like to teach math classes designed for those who are trying to become teachers, as well as professional development or master's courses for those who are already practicing teachers.  I'm currently a math professor in the south.  I'm a post-doc, which is a temporary 1-3 year position that you get after your degree to give you more experience so that you can get a permanent position.  It worked.  I will be starting a permanent (tenure track) position in Colorado this summer.  I want to settle permanently in Colorado, and I hope that I will work at this same University until I retire.  I'm hoping someone might remember what it was like to be at the beginning of their career, and be willing to help me out.

And now, as of Friday, April 4, 2008, we received a signed letter of intent from Ford Motor Company to provide VinyasaMT and the data management services behind it, to over 100 of Ford’s approved accessory suppliers.

I am interested in obtaining a loan in order to pay off all of my credit cards.  I have a stable career and have been in the same line of business since 2001.  During my college years I acquired multiple credit cards and sunk into debt.  I haven't had any late pays since early 2001.  I am the proud father of two children and husband to an amazing wife.  In 2004 my daughter broke her arm.  Due to problems with the insurance company I had at the time two collection accounts appeared on my credit file in 2005.  One for 97 dollars and another for 45.  Both have been paid off.  The first by the insurance company and the second by myself.  I have literally destroyed all of my credit cards and look forward to the day I can be free of all debt.  I thank you for helping me reach that goal and can assure you I have never defaulted on any loan.  ,debt_consolidation,Path to freedom from credit card debt,760xx,TX,21.83,0.0,Dec-1993,2.0,61.0,,14.0,0.0,12025,37.2,21.0,f,0.0,0.0,8489.4723466977,2925.32,7199.97,1289.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,Apr-2011,237.94,,Feb-2019,0.0,,1,Individual,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cash,N,,,,,,

I went to several banks for a business start-up loan, but to no avail. To get the business up and started, I had to resort to credit cards to provide the capital to get the business going.  I had as many as 12 players in the academy in the fall. Due to economic hardship for parents of a couple of the players and injuries, I have dropped to a current level of five players with five more to start the fall of 2008. In the mean time, losing those players who began last fall has cost me almost $25,000 in revenue for Spring 2008. Despite that loss, I have averaged almost $7000 of gross revenue per month over the past three months. With the higher interst rates, I would like to pay off the four cards with a balance of $23,575 with a consolidated loan, thus lowering my monthly payment and reducing the amount of cost to the start-up of the company.

I want to honor the debit AND to pay it off as quickly as possible. I have had folks tell me to not pay the hospital and for me frankly that is not honorable or morally right. So I am looking for solutions to pay comfortably and to pay fully.<br/><br/>What makes me a good borrower? I am dedicated to honesty and doing the right thing. I do not ever give up no matter the challenges I face. I will succeed. I will continue to live and I will be healthly both physically and with my resources.<br/><br/>My monthly budget? I have about 5 credit cards and two bank loans and one large loan to the hospital. I have the obvious mortgage, auto loan and insurance, household mthly (electric, gas, water, etc). I make a good income and would simply like to be less strapped at the end of paying all my bills and feel like its ok to go to a movie every so often AND get popcorn. Main goal is to consolidate and lower interest rates. Willing to be loans in full just would like to lower the overall interest rates.<br/><br/>How stable is my job? Totally. I am very well respected in my profession and in my company. They saught me out after hearing about my cancer and have supported me as if I were family thorughout the entire process. My previous job I was at for 18+ years and there to held a high position.

I also hold a degree in engineering from one of the nation’s top universities. The CQF is equivalent to a Master's in Financial Engineering.  I have been admitted to the program and have made the first 2 payments of $2,858.00. My remaining balance is $11,432.00. I am seeking a loan of $4,500.00 as the remaining balance will be financed elsewhere.   Sallie Mae and other providers (FASFA) have specialized career training loans; unfortunately, the training program must be based out of the USA to be eligible for funding. The CQF is provided by 7City Learning LTD based out of London, UK. Thus the piecewise funding.  50% of the delegates attend the course in London. The other 50% attend via their distance learning program as I am. This year’s class has 198 delegates. Record numbers!  Thank you and take care.

Those of you who are not familiar with the Baker University program, students are able to finish their core degree requirements on a flexible schedule (1 class at a time) that caters towards working professionals.  However, since I went into the program with 32 hours of electives still to take. When my program concludes in May, 2009, I will still be left with 32 hours of credits to take before I officially receive my business degree. That’s why I have opted to finish up these elective credits at my local community college over the next two semesters. Unfortunately, JCCC does not offer financial aid to students not enrolled in degree programs. However, an advantage of taking class at a community college is that tuition is less expensive and I still have the flexibility of taking classes online.
