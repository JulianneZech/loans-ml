Status:Fully Paid,n,,"  Borrower added on 05/12/10 > Upcoming non-profit anime convention needs your help! Our original plans were to rely on pre-registrations for the event, but we've found out the hard way that anime fans tend to procrastinate quite a bit! We're a non-profit organization starting with zero funds, and our event is coming up within the next couple of weeks. We're expecting as many as 750 attendees to come and socialize, learn about Japanese animation and culture, and meet some awesome industry guests. We have deposits and printing costs coming very shortly (this weekend for starters), and we don't have enough cash to pay for everything!<br/><br/>We're seeking your help to get us through this period, and at-the-door registrations should be more than enough to pay back this loan. Even if we don't break even, I am personally prepared to pay the rest of this loan off. I've never had a missed or late payment, and my career has just started three years ago with the energy company I work for.<br/><br/>Please feel free to ask my any questions! I'm not allowed to post in these comments any personal information, but I can hint that this event is in the Southwest, and will be held the first weekend of June.<br/> Borrower added on 05/23/10 > We're getting closer to our convention. Our pre-registration numbers have gone up significantly, and this has helped pay for some of our more immediate costs. We're going to see about cutting some more corners and costs to be able to afford the more important things. THANK YOU to those who have already invested!

It's really touching to see people helping me that don't even know me.  I guarantee you, you won't be disappointed; I won't let you down.    <br/><br/>I don't know what information you have about me but, my &quot;loan grade&quot; is where it's at because my debt to income ratio is high.  However, I've never been late paying any of my bills.  Furthermore, I am married, so I do have extra income.  If I get fully funded, I'm going to pay off my accounts with the highest balance and highest interest rates.  I'll be paying close to the same amount every month but my debt will be paid off in five years instead of thirty!  I've <br/>already been paying more than the minimum amount due to the other accounts so, they'll be paid off within the next three <br/>years.<br/><br/>Althouth this may hurt my chances with some of you, some of you may want to know, I'm a police officer.  As a government employee, I have a stable position.  Since I've been employed with the department (for five years), my income has increased $30,000 annually.  It's because I anticipated this extra income that I've accumulated so much debt over the years.  I'm ashamed of how much money I could be saving for retirement or my children's<br/>college but am paying to debt instead.<br/><br/>Anyway, thank you for taking the time to read this.  I really appreciate your time and support.

Finally, I gained US citizenship and immediately applied for a job with at the State Department.  After a lengthy clearance process, I have now started as a strat comms officer on the newly formed Civilian Response Corps.  However, the move from Boston to DC was not paid for by my new employer and I incurred a lot of expense.  The move has set me back and I would like to get back on track as I start my new career.<br/><br/>Hopefully, some of this description has helped to explain my current predicament but also put your minds at ease given some of the information.  As a US Gov't employee, it is in my interest to behave more responsibly than your average borrower.  Plus, given the unique nature of my job (ie deployed to parts of the world most fear to tread), I expect to have my salary augmented by 'hardship' pay once I'm fully trained and deployed in the field.  Therefore, I expect to repay the loan a little earlier than expected but, for those of you interested in a little return on your investment, this probably won't occur within the first two years of the loan.  <br/><br/>I do have a couple of marks on my financial record, which despite my good credit now will cause some pause among lenders.  I get that.  However, the two separate incidents had more to do with administrative blunders, ie failing to set up the auto payment correctly before leaving the country for 6 weeks (for work) than they do about my unwillingness or inability to pay.  I learned VERY quickly from this and have maintained exemplary credit ever since.  And, I refer you back to my current employment status as evidence that this is the case.  <br/><br/>I appreciate any assistance this forum can provide and I'm grateful to your willingness to take the risk and help out.  I can only assure you, for whatever assurance you get online, that I am responsible, upstanding and have NO intention of defaulting on any loan, ever.<br/>",moving,DC State move,200xx,DC,4.33,2.0,Aug-2001,1.0,15.0,,4.0,0.0,0,0.0,18.0,f,0.0,0.0,20815.4557717975,20711.38,15000.0,5815.46,0.0,0.0,0.0,Mar-2013,9340.71,,Jun-2015,0.0,,1,Individual,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cash,N,,,,,,

My pension plan does not allow more than one loan at a time. I need approximately $18,000 to pay off my current loan. I would like to borrow $18,000 from Lending Club to pay off my current pension plan loan. I will then re-apply for another loan with my pension plan to take advantage of my higher pension plan balance. I will then pay Lending Club back as soon as my old Pension Plan loan is paid off and the new loan is issued.   My employer and I renegotiated my contract for five years adding about $1,000 a month to my income. I now make $128,000 per year. In January 2010 I will be making and addtional $2,500 per year. I  have a clause in my contract that if I am fired, I will be paid three months pay as well as my sick time and vacation time. I have been working here for nearly three years. Due to a signed contract I will be another five years.  It is my intention to repay the loan I borrow from Lending Club within 30 days. This pension plan at my current workplace has a balance of nearly $60,000 and the plan allows for up to 50% loan. In addition I have another $10,000 in my 457(b) (Deferred Comp Plan) which I will tap into to assist me in paying as much of my credit card debt as I can.   I will secure the loan I get from you against the balance in my 401(a) Pension Plan until it is paid in full (again, I believe it should be less than one month).  My overall intention is to pay off about $15,000 in credit card debt. At that point I will only have $4,000 left which I will pay for in six months. I will then be paying off the pension plan loan.  (Chase $5,550.00, Discover $5,250.00 and Chase #2 $4,750.00)  Due to the short term nature of the loan, I am willing to pay up to a 1.5% fee plus an interest rate of up to 10%. My calculations are that Lending Club will make about $420 for a loan of $18,000 for thirty days.  This is a long story but I am trying to pay off all my debt (including my mortgage) in the next 84 months. This will greatly assist me in doing that.  By borrowing against my Pension I will receive the 7% interest being paid to above credit cards. I have excellent credit. I want to keep it that way.
